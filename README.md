# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

SUMMARY:
This project was created using express.js, a little bit of mongoose and postman to test if I put together a properly working server. The express.js help me create and run a server. then I use postman test the server and make sure i have no errors.Then the errors that did come in to make sure that they were handled properly.
